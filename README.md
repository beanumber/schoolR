# schoolR

An R package that provides a simple and accessible approach for elementary through high school students and their educators to engage in R and solidify their understanding of mathematical concepts. 

## Installation
To install, run the following code: 
```
devtools::install_github(https://github.com/sunniraleigh/schoolR) 
```

## Getting Started
For a more detailed guide about what functions do and exmaples about how to use them, see the [vignette](./vignettes/schoolR.Rmd).

## Usage
This package should be used in a classroom setting as a supplemental material for math courses, or as part of an R group dedicated to teaching younger students.
It provides functions to help students develop a deeper understanding of how area is caclulated, and how to analyze trends in graphs.
This package also lets teachers produce practice problems, while specifying the operation, number of problems to generate, and magnitude of numbers involved. 
It will be used by teachers and students in collaboration. It will allow students to begin understanding more complex, big picture math concepts by using R without having to first learn all of the details of coding.
